# Exploratory checklists, Test cases( inc. - E2E, Corner ), Usability report

<b>My third project that I participated during my time in Cerebrum Hub.</b>

<b>Project about:</b>

  - <c>During the third project, the testing teams were working on a real project - [Income Marketplace](https://getincome.com/)

  - The testing teams tested the Investor portal and API of the system to ensure that the main functions are stable. 
  
  - Wery limited and incomplete documentation about the project:
  
    - API documentation covered what was necessary for testing, but was outdated with incomplete loose ends for what all ID's was meant to do.</c>
